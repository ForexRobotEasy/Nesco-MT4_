## How it Works
1. Included Libraries: The necessary libraries, GPT-4_COPILOT and MQL5_CLOUD_NETWORK, are imported to provide additional functionalities and access to the MQL5 Cloud Network.
2. Constants: The code defines various constants such as notification phone number, strategy types, trading symbols, minimum deposit requirements, and trading times for each strategy.
3. Global Variables: The code defines global variables to store the current strategy and whether attention is required.
4. Financial Event Fetching: The `fetchFinancialEvents()` function is responsible for fetching financial events globally and updating the relevant market data.
5. Notification Sending: The `sendNotification()` function is used to send notifications to users' phones using the specified phone number.
6. Order Execution: Functions like `executeBuyOrder()`, `executeSellOrder()`, `executeStopLossOrder()`, `executeTakeProfitOrder()`, and `executeTrailingStop()` are provided to execute different types of trading orders for a given symbol and volume/price.
7. Market Analysis: The `analyzeMarket()` function performs market analysis using advanced technologies. It updates the current strategy based on the analysis and checks if attention is required.
8. Trading Execution: The `executeTrading()` function executes trading based on the current strategy. It uses a switch statement to determine the appropriate trading actions for each strategy.
9. Initialization: The `OnInit()` function initializes the Nesco MT4 Forex Trading Software. It sets the initial current strategy and connects to the MQL5 Cloud Network. It also fetches financial events.
10. Trading Events Handling: The `OnTick()` function is called for each tick of the trading platform. It analyzes the market, executes trading based on the current strategy, and sends a notification if attention is required.
11. Program Shutdown: The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program is stopped. It disconnects from the MQL5 Cloud Network.
12. Error Handling: The `OnError()` function handles program errors and displays error messages.
13. Program Shutdown: The `OnShutdown()` function is called when the program is shut down. It performs any necessary shutdown tasks.
